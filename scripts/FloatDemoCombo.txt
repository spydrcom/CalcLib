// note the odd numbered values which should be 0 as evidence that even 
// the low numbered results introduce error quickly, higher ones become impossible.

// in a later demo script the Bernoulli sequence is computed using prime fractions.
// the first 30 values are computed precisely as can be verified with online sites.

// the correct value of GAMMA(6) = 5! = 120, so this approximation is off by 2%
